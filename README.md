### The DAO Tool is built for DAO members to help them achieve DAO Team management in the best and most decentralized manner.
## It includes: 

**1) DAO NFT Membership:** DAO admin can create role based NFT drop and send it to DAO members. By receiving role based NFT, members can log in and access only a particular area of their Dashboard as per permissions granted to their role.

### How its made: 
We have built this platform with Reactjs as a frontend, Polygon for smart contracts and other bonty integration for various functionalities. 
- Payroll management system of The DAO Tool has been achieved through the use of superfluid. 
- IPFS  Web3 storage has been used for permanent storage of DAO documents on DAO drive
- Skill wallet is used to login into the TheDAOTool to access the dashboard as per permissions granted to the member.
- Graph: Subgraph query is used to fetch the outgoing payroll salary stream being distributed to DAO members.
